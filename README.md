# Regression analysis of hockey game audience

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This project tries to predict spectator count at Oulun Kärpät hockey games using linear regression. Data used in analysis includes the date of the game, time of the game, who they are playing against, is it a home game and current win streak.

## Background

Predicted audience might be useful for the organizers, advertisers or sponsors.

## How is it used?

The used data is narrow and doesn't provide accurate results as it is. The one test case however was pretty close as seen in the example. More data and different data types might make prediction more accurate.



## Data sources and AI methods

Project uses numpy, sklearn and pandas.
Data was scraped from [Eurohockey](https://eurohockey.com/).
## Challenges

Main challenge is that the audience count is affected by many things such as weather, other events on that date and news/hype around teams which are not taken into account in this project and could be hard to track.
Predicting audience is not unethical.

## What next?

To make prediction better more data should be gathered and all other affecting things should be thought of. Organizers probably already have better ways to predict the audience so this project was good for learning but should not be developed further.

## Acknowledgments
This project for elementsofai was adapted from my earlier project.
